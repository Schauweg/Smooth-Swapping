<h3 align="center">About:</h3>

Smooth Swapping is a client-side mod that animates item movements inside of inventories.

- Has been in development ever since the release of 1.19.4 and is available for both Fabric and Forge on 1.18+ (The 1.17.1 version is exclusive to Fabric).

- Even though it is written using Architectury, it does **not** need the Architectury API - neither for Forge nor for Fabric.

- If you use the Fabric version you'll need [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) to make it function and [Modmenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) to able to access the settings menu.
